# STAT145-FINAL-PROJECT
This is my final project for STA-145. I took the education level of each U.S. governor from 2000-present. I am seeking to find out if the respective education level of each governor holds and effect, or correlates to, the amount of annual the governor earns while in office.

# INSTRUCTIONS
To access and utilize the script, open the "STA145-FORTUNE3.R" file, which contains the code for my project. To access the dataset, open the "data.csv" file.

# DATA
The data collected for this project was the reported annual salary of each U.S. governor in each of the 50 states from 2000-present during their time in office. The main goal of this analysis is to see if their education level is what effected how much income they earn, or if income is the unrelated to their education, and is instead caused by other variables, such as their respective governing state.
