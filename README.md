# STAT145-FINAL-PROJECT
This is my final project for STA-145. I researched the education level and reported salary of each U.S. governor from 2000 to the present. I am seeking to find out if the respective education level of each governor holds an effect, or is associated with, the amount of salary each governor earned while in office. 

# INSTRUCTIONS
To access and utilize the script, open the "STA145-FORTUNE3.R" file, which contains the code for my project. To access the dataset, open the "data.csv UPDATED" file.

# DATA
The data collected for this project was the reported annual salary of every U.S. governor in each of the fifty states from 2000 to the present during their time in office. The main goal of this analysis is to see if their education level effected how much income they earn, or if income is the unrelated to their education level, and is instead caused by other variables, such as their governing state.

# OPERALIZATION
To operationalize the salary of the U.S. governors since 2000, I went to Google and used Wikepedia as my main source, and I recorded each governor's cummilative  salary reported at the end of their term. 

I also used Wikepedia to find the education levels of each governor.

Salary was operationalized by reviewing each governor's public record of income and curating a range of potential salaries that are both mutually exclusive and exhaustive for any possible salary that governors may earn. The codes of these variables are ordinal. The lowest range of values starts at the typically estimated income for U.S. citizens in the upper 20%, that being $106,000, but also includes any and every potenial income lesser than. Each value following increases in range by $36,000. The highest range of values ends at the typically estimated income for U.S. citizens well-off in the upper 5%, that being $214,000, but also includes any and every possible income greater than. Also included is a value for any governor who may not have taken their earned salary, and instead may have donated it or dispersed it back into their respective state.

Education level was also operationalized as qualitative and ordinal. The values of education level follow the typical order of the American education system. Since there is no specific degree required to be a governor, the values for this variable are mutually exclusive and exhaustive. The code starts at High school Diploma, and proceeds with each potential college degree that could be obtained. The degrees included in the code are Associates Degree, earned after two years, Bachelors Degree, earned after four years, Masters, Doctorate, Law Degree. Another variable included is an Honorary Doctorate, which is not a Doctorate level of education, but symbolizes any recognizable achievements a governor may have had in their university. There is zero reported history of any governors 2000 and after that did not earn any a diploma at any level recorded by these variables, which is why this level is not included.
