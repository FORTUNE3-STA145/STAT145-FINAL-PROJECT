# STAT145-FINAL-PROJECT
This is my final project for STA-145. I took the education level of each U.S. governor from 2000 to the present. I am seeking to find out if the respective education level of each governor holds and effect, or correlates to, the amount of annual the governor earns while in office.

# INSTRUCTIONS
To access and utilize the script, open the "STA145-FORTUNE3.R" file, which contains the code for my project. To access the dataset, open the "data.csv" file.

# DATA
The data collected for this project was the reported annual salary of each U.S. governor in each of the 50 states from 2000-present during their time in office. The main goal of this analysis is to see if their education level is what effected how much income they earn, or if income is the unrelated to their education, and is instead caused by other variables, such as their respective governing state.

# OPERALIZATION
To operalizationize the salary of the U.S. governors since 2000, I went to Google, the main source being Wikepedia, and took down each governor's cummilative  salary reported at the end of their term. 

I also used Wikepedia to find the education levels of each governor.

The concept of governor salary was operalizationized by reviewing their public records of income.
