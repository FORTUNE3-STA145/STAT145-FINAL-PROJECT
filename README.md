# STAT145-FINAL-PROJECT
This is my final project for STA-145. I took the education level of each U.S. governor from 2000 to the present. I am seeking to find out if the respective education level of each governor holds and effect, or correlates to, the amount of annual the governor earns while in office.

# INSTRUCTIONS
To access and utilize the script, open the "STA145-FORTUNE3.R" file, which contains the code for my project. To access the dataset, open the "data.csv" file.

# DATA
The data collected for this project was the reported annual salary of each U.S. governor in each of the 50 states from 2000-present during their time in office. The main goal of this analysis is to see if their education level is what effected how much income they earn, or if income is the unrelated to their education, and is instead caused by other variables, such as their respective governing state.

# OPERALIZATION
To operalizationize the salary of the U.S. governors since 2000, I went to Google and used Wikepedia as my main source, and took down each governor's cummilative  salary reported at the end of their term. 

I also used Wikepedia to find the education levels of each governor.

The concept of salary was operalizationized by reviewing each governor's public record of income and coming up with a reasonable range of potenial salaries that are both mutually exclusive and exhaustive to any potential salary that governors may earn. The codes of this variable are ordinal. The lowest range of values starts at the typically estimated income for U.S. citizens in the upper-middle-class, that being $106,000, but also includes any and every potenial income lesser than. Each value following increases in range by $36,000. The highest range of values ends at the typically estimated income for U.S. citizens well off in the upper-class, that being $214,000, but also includes any and every potential income greater than. Included is also any governor who may not have taken their earned salary, and instead may have donated it or dispersed it back into their respective state.

The concept of education level was operalizationized in a similar way, for it is also ordinal. Education level follows in the typical order of the American education system. Since there is no specific degree required to be a governor, the values for this variable are mutually exclusive and exhaustive. The code starts at High school Diploma, and proceeds with each potential college degree that could be obtained. The degrees included in the codes are Associates Degree, earned after two years, Bachelors Degree, earned after four years, Masters, Doctorate, Law Degree, and Honorary Doctorate. There is zero reported history of any governors 2000 and after that did not earn any a diploma at any level recorded by these variables.
